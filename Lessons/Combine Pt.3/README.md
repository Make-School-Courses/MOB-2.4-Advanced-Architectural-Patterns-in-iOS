# Combine

## [Slides](https://make-school-courses.github.io/MOB-2.4-Advanced-Architectural-Patterns-in-iOS/Slides/Combine-Pt.2/README.html ':ignore')

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

**Implement**:
- Combine to update UI with UIKit
- Combine to fetch and display data 

<!-- > -->

## @Published

A type that publishes a property marked with an attribute.

```swift
@propertyWrapper struct Published<Value>
```
- Publishing a property with the `@Published` attribute creates a publisher of this type. 
- You access the publisher with the $ operator
- Class constrained

<!-- v -->

```swift
class Weather {
    ...
    @Published var temperature : Int!
    ...
    let _ = $temperature
        .sink() { value in
            print ("Temperature now: \(value)")
    }
}
```

## Integration with UIKIt

Declarative UI updates from user input.

<!-- > -->

## Integration with Networking

Fetching, transforming and displaying data.

<!-- > -->

## After Class

Combine is a new framework and it will take more reading and practice to get used to it. But you can start using what you already know, little by little. ðŸ˜‰
