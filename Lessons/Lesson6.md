## Learning Objectives (5 min)

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

1. Describe:
- the **Proxy** and **Facade** patterns
- the software construction problem each is intended to solve
- potential use cases for each (when to use them)
3. Assess:
- the suitability of a given design pattern to solve a given problem
- the trade offs (pros/cons) inherent in each
4. Implement basic examples of both patterns explored in this class

#### Facade

The Facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem: a library, a framework, or a complex system of classes.


#### Implementation Notes



##### Simplified Example

In this example, three simple classes - `SubSystemOne`, `SubSystemTwo`, and `SubSystemThree` - represent three separate systems, each potentially with its own set of functions and/or properties.

Though these are classes, each one could be a separate collection of related classes, as in an API.

```Swift
///Subsystem 1
class SubSystemOne {

    func performActionOne()
    {
        // Do something cool...
        print("printing on line \(#line) in function \(#function)")
    }
}

///Subsystem 2
class SubSystemTwo {

    func performActionTwo()
    {
        // Do something else cool...
        print("printing on line \(#line) in function \(#function)")
    }
}

///Subsystem 3
class SubSystemThree {

    func performActionThree(item: String)
    {
        // Do something even more cool...
        print("printing on line \(#line) in function \(#function), with \(item) passed as the arg")
    }
}
```

Note that after *wrapping* each of the three "subsystems," the Facade class can choose which behaviors of a given subsystem are to be exercised. The Facade class can also aggregate similar subsystem functions into a single function, simplifying the executions of several functions.

```Swift

///Facade class
class Facade {
    let subSystemOne = SubSystemOne()
    let subSystemTwo = SubSystemTwo()
    let subSystemThree = SubSystemThree()

    func performActionA() {

        print("printing on line \(#line) in function \(#function) from Facade class")

        subSystemOne.performActionOne()
        subSystemTwo.performActionTwo()
    }

    func performActionB() {

        print("printing on line \(#line) in function \(#function) from Facade class")

        subSystemOne.performActionOne()
        subSystemThree.performActionThree(item: "Thing")
    }
}

///Client
let facade = Facade()
facade.performActionA()
facade.performActionB()

/* This will print:

 printing on line 41 in function performActionA() from Facade class
 printing on line 9 in function performActionOne()
 printing on line 19 in function performActionTwo()
 printing on line 49 in function performActionB() from Facade class
 printing on line 9 in function performActionOne()
 printing on line 29 in function performActionThree(item:), with Thing passed as the arg
 */

##### Example 1


```Swift
import UIKit

final class Defaults {

    private let defaults: UserDefaults

    init(defaults: UserDefaults = .standard) {
        self.defaults = defaults
    }

    subscript(key: String) -> String? {
        get {
            return defaults.string(forKey: key)
        }

        set {
            defaults.set(newValue, forKey: key)
        }
    }
}

// Client
let storage = Defaults()

// Store
storage["Bishop"] = "Disconnect me. I’d rather be nothing"

// Read
storage["Bishop"]
```
