1. Here is an imperative version of a function called `doubleIt` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array after doubling every item in the initial array:

```swift
func doubleIt(inputArray: Array<Int>) {

    var results = [Int]()

    for num in inputArray {
        results.append(num * 2)
    }
    print(results)
}

doubleIt(inputArray: [1,2,3]) // [2,4,6]
```

**TODO:**

Code the declarative (FP) version of `doubleIt`so that it achieves the same result as the code above by using the `map` function instead of the `for loop`

<!--
```swift
func doubleIt(inputArray: Array<Int>) {

    // TODO: Use map here...
    let results = ??
    print(results)
}

doubleIt(inputArray: [1,2,3]) // [2,4,6]
```
-->

2. Suppose we have an array containing strings representing the contents of a directory:

let exampleFiles = ["README.md", "HelloWorld.swift", "FlappyBird.swift"]

Now suppose we want an array of all the .swift files. This is easy to compute with a simple loop. Use the HOF filter.

3. Define a function that sums all the integers in an array.

4. Suppose we have the following struct, consisting of a cityâ€™s name and population (measured in thousands of inhabitants):

```swift
struct City {
  let name: String
  let population: Int
}

extension City {
  func scalingPopulation() -> City {
    return City(name: name, population: population * 1000)
  }
}
```
We can define several example cities:

```swift
let cities = [paris, madrid, amsterdam, berlin]
```

Print a list of cities with at least one million inhabitants, together with their total populations.
