# MOB 2.4 Project Specifications - Contributing to Open Source

### What you'll do

You will first find a project to make a contribution to, it can't be one of your own. Make **at least two contributions** (you can do more). They can be in the same project or different ones.

For this course...

*What counts as a contribution?*

✅ A well documented and submitted Pull Request:

- Resolving an Issue
- Proposing changes (think about what from this course can you put into practice to improve an existing project regarding design and architectural patterns)
- Adding a new feature
- Adding tests

*What is **not** as a contribution?*

❌ Changes to documentation only or fixing typos.

### Requirements

- [ ] Two documented and submitted Pull Requests
- [ ] Projects use one or more of the following:
  - Swift
  - UIKit
  - SwiftUI
  - or any other Apple Framework
- [ ] PR are submitted with a template
- [ ] Contributions are submitted according to due dates

### Due dates

Wed Feb 17         | Wed Mar 3
------------       |  -------------
First PR submitted | Second PR submitted (or more)
Share in class     | Reviewed by instructor only

### Sharing progress

When you are done with your first contribution, you'll share your progress in class by answering the following questions:

- What project are you contributing to?
- Why did you choose that project?
- What was your contribution?
- What was a challenge you faced? How did you solve it?
- What's the status of the PR right now?

You can do slides for this check in if it helps you deliver the update. **Keep it to less than 5 min**.

### Rubric

- **25 pts each** - Valid PR submitted
- **5 pts each**  - PR uses a template
- **10 pts once** - Sharing progress in class by Feb 17

You need at least **70 points** to pass the course.

### Resources

If the project you are contributing to doesn't specify a format to submit the PR, use [this template](PRTemplate.md).
