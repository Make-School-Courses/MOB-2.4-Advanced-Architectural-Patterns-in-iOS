# MOB 2.4: Advanced Architecture in iOS

## Course Description

We will be exploring interesting architectural patterns that will help you build rock solid iOS apps. We will review the architectural paradigms and then do a deep dive into a cutting edge iOS patterns like Functional Programming & Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

## Prerequisites:  

[MOB-2.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-2.3-Concurrency-Parallelism-in-iOS)

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 14 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Analyze and apply different creational, behavioral and structural patterns.
1. Implement MVVM, Coordinators as architectural patterns.
1. Use functional programming in Swift.
1. Evaluate when to implement Reactive Programming in their projects.
